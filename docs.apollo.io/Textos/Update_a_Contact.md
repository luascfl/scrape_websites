Use the Update a Contact endpoint to update existing contacts in your team's Apollo account.

In Apollo terminology, a contact is a person that your team has explicitly added to your database. A contact will have their data enriched in some way, such as accessing an email address or a phone number.

To create a new contact, use the Create a Contact endpoint instead. To update the contact stage for multiple contacts, use the Update Contact Stage for Multiple Contacts endpoint.
