**For Apollo users**: You need to create an API key to access the Apollo API. The API key should be included in the header of your API request.

The Create API Keys article details how to create a new key and ensure that it is ready to use.

**For Apollo partners**: To make API requests on behalf of an Apollo user, you need to implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow.

If you'd like to promote an integration you've built to Apollo's APIs, you may submit an application to have the integration feature on Apollo’s Marketplace.
