Use the Bulk Update Contacts endpoint to update multiple contacts in your team's Apollo account simultaneously.

This endpoint allows you to update common fields across multiple contacts efficiently, such as contact stages, owners, custom fields, and other contact attributes.

You can update up to 100 contacts per request. For larger batches, the system will process the updates asynchronously.
