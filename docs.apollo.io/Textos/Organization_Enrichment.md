Use the Oganization Enrichment endpoint to enrich data for 1 company. To enrich data for up to 10 companies with a single API call, use the Bulk Organization Enrichment endpoint instead.

Enriched data potentially includes industry information, revenue, employee counts, funding round details, and corporate phone numbers and locations.
