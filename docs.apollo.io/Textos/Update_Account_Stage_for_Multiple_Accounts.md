Use the Update Account Stage for Multiple Accounts endpoint to update the account stage for several account in your team's Apollo account.

To update more than the account stage, such as domains or phone numbers, use the Update an Account endpoint instead.

This endpoint requires a master API key. If you attempt to call the endpoint without a master key, you will receive a `403`

response. Refer to Create API Keys to learn how to create a master API key.
