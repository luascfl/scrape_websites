Use the Organization Job Postings endpoint to retrieve the current job postings for companies. This can help you identify companies that are growing headcount in areas that are strategically important for you.

Calling this endpoint does consume credits as part of your Apollo pricing plan.

To protect Apollo's performance for all users, this endpoint has a display limit of 10,000 records. This limitation does not restrict your access to Apollo's database; you just need to access the data in batches.
